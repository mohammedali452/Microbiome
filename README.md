# Microbiome Analysis Project
This project aims to create a Machine Learning model that is able to detect various diseases based on data found within a patient's Gut Microbiome. We utilized FASTA/FASTQ Files from the NIH Human Microbiome Project and QIIME to create the OTU Tables. Actual Model was developed in Python 3.6
